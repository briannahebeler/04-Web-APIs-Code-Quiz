# NJ Devils Trivia Quiz

## Description

In this project my goal was to create a multiple choice quiz on JavaScript. This quiz will be timed and will store high scores. The application runs in the web browser displaying a clean, polished, and responsive user interface, made through utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS.

When the user clicks the start button the quiz's timer starts and they are presented with the first of five multiple choice questions. Once the user answers the question and presses "next" they will be presented with the next question. If they answer any questions wrong time will subtracted from the timer.

Once the timer reaches 0 or the user answers all the questions and presses "submit", whichever comes first, then the game is over.

After the game is over the user will be prompted to enter their initials to save their score in the high score library.
